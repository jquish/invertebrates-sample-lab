### Panarthropoda, Arthropod general & Chelicerates  
\
**30 September, 2016**  
**Associated Readings:  Pechenik Ch 14, 341-358, Ch 15**  
\
This week’s lab introduces you to the “Panarthropoda”, a set of ecdysozoan phyla that includes the arthropods and closely related lineages. We’ll also begin our focus on Arthropoda with an introduction to the chelicerates – the subphylum that includes arachnids.  
\
Included in the lab are drawings of external anatomy, looking at slides and preserved specimens, identifying spiders using a dichotomous key, and behavioral and anatomical demonstrations of extremely cool spiders and their relatives. There are 
**4 required drawings for this lab**
and a few other recommended sketches.  Take time to marvel at the diversity represented in this most remarkable group of organisms.  
\
The organisms you will be looking at fall within the following taxonomic groups: 
<div class="indent">
  * **Ecdysozoa**
  * **Panarthropoda**
  * **Phylum Tardigrada (slides and live specimens)**
  * **Phylum Onycophora (preserved specimens and slides)**

#### Phyla Onychophora and Tardigrada (included in Panarthropoda) (Ch 15) 

These are two small groups that historically had unclear evolutionary relationships to other invertebrates.  Recent molecular phylogenetic analyses strongly supports these two phyla as being relatives of arthropods with onychophorans the sister group to arthropods, and Tardigrades sister to that group.  Fossil evidence suggests that onychophorans have undergone very little phenotypic change and they are considered by some as "living fossils" and a "missing link" between annelids and arthropods.  
<br>

##### Phylum Onychophora 
Diversity:  approx 100 species described  
Humid habitats mostly in the tropics  
Important Characteristics:
<div class="indent">
  * soft body, thin cuticle of not-articulating plates; grow by molting; little cephalization; 3 paired appendages on head - **fleshy antennae**, pair of **jaws**, pair of **oral papillae; appendages unjointed; paired segmental nephridia; tracheae-spiracular system; reduced coelom; slime glands.**
</div>
\
***Drawing 4.1 Internal anatomy of Onycophora.***  
<div class="indent">
* Look at a cross section of *Peripatus*. Draw this and label the **heart (dorsal vessel), circular muscles, longitudinal muscles, nerve cord, leg, gut, body cavity, cuticle.** You may or may not be able to see uterus or testes depending on the where the slice was taken to make the slide. Refer to figure 15.4 of Pechenik and the figures below.
</div>

\
**See the preserved specimen of Onychophora. We only have two – please be careful with them and return them promptly if you take them to the microscope.**
<br><br>

##### Phylum Tardigrada 
Diversity:  > 900 species described  
Semiaquatic habitats - water films on mosses and plants, soil and forest litter  
Important Characteristics:  
<div class="indent">
* **4 pairs of ventral legs, each ending in 1 to many (12) "toes" with adhesive pads or claws;** body covered by thin cuticle occasionally divided into plates;  growth by **molting; coelom reduced;** no curculatory or gas exchange systems (they're very small- 0.1 to 0.5 mm); nervous system metamerous; **gonochoristic.**
</div>
\
Tardigrades are called "water bears" due to the presence of "claws" on their eight legs and their slow, lumbering movements.  In times of low water availability they form dormant cysts called tuns.  In this state the tardigrades are dessicated and have an extremely low level of metabolism.   Tuns are very resistent to extreme temperature (+149°C - -272°C), chemicals, radiation and lack of oxygen. 
\
\
See Pg. 422, Fig 15.3 for additional images.   Can you believe how cute these are and that we’re surrounded by them. How lucky are we!  
\

![tardigrade ventral](lab4-images/tardigradeventral.jpeg)
\
\
See the slides of tardigrades in the teaching collection, and be able to identify them. Try to zoom in on their toes and see their eyes. The morphology is hard to see so I won’t have you draw them.  
**Everyone is required to see live Tardigrades from moss collected from trees on campus. To do this:**

1. Collect moss from a tree and immerse it in water in a watch glass.
2. After about 30 minutes, place a droplet of water with a bit of moss onto a depression slide.
2. Look at it under 10x magnification
3. Look for transparent animals with legs that are bumbling over the moss.
\
**(Note - you may also see nematodes and rotifers on the moss.)**

##### SPIDER IDENTIFICATION – Introduction to using a dichotomous key

I will give each of your tables a spider that is unlabeled. You will work through a dichotomous key to identify the spider.
